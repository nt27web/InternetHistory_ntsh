                <p>Internet’s origin goes back to the 1950’s and has touched so many lives since then. During the Gulf
                    war,
                    when crisis arose to be better informed the U.S. Department of Defense decided to fund ARPANET for
                    their
                    research in this area. At that time, ARPANET used packet switching allowing multiple computers to
                    communicate with each other on a single network. After years of research and work in this field, on
                    October 29, 1969, a first message was delivered from a “node to node” communication from one
                    computer to
                    another by ARPAnet. </P>

                <p>During this era, telephone exchange worked differently where a middleman had to connect to callers.
                    Damaged
                    communication became a bottleneck during the Nuclear attacks. Communications became an issue without
                    the
                    middleman connecting the two callers. The telephone exchange wanted to analyze and improve its
                    operations.
                    Research starting to spur around how many circuits would be required to provide a service for people
                    not to be
                    on hold for too long to talk with the person on the other end of the call. Queuing theory was
                    introduced and
                    named after the founder of this theory; the international unit of telephone is called the Erlang.
                    Queuing theory
                    is referred to as the mathematical study of the formation, function, and congestion of waiting
                    lines, or
                    queues.</p>
