<p>Young guy from no where made the amazing media to connect with our close ones called the Facebook ,the billion dollar company. Before all this took place the real guy who woke the world up was a company called Napster. A company which shared music over the internet. Before the music was sold in CDS and Tapes. This guy young made a collection of all the songs from the internet. Made a file in the web , where he could share the latest songs to the whole world. The Napster really came to demand ,because college students wanted to listen to music and they never wanted to pay. After few years it was all over the world. The destroyed all the music companies. They made sure that great artist came over to the office to stop illegal sharing of music. Later they were charged a case by the music head for sharing of music in an illegal way. After paying the law .The company had to shutdown . This made people realize that internet can help in changing the world. YouTube was also charged by the law of copyright , but after google buying it was on the safe hand because google could handle all the problems.</p>
<p>Another start up Company called the Myspace changed the way the world connects, with in span of few years the had for search for myspace then google. Later due to the rapid growth the company was brought for 1 billion dollars. The same way the young  guy from Harvard drop out made Facebook which made the world to connect to people in a very easy way.</p>
